# slides-translate
Set of scripts to manage the translation of GSuite Slides

We use GSuite Slides for the teaching material in classes. In order to support the translation of slides decks in multiple languages we use python scripts and the drive API to extract texts from slides, store the strings in sheets and create translations based on translated strings from sheets.
